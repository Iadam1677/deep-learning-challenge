# deep-learning-challenge
Overview
This project utilizes a deep learning model to predict the success of charity funding applications based on historical data. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and follows a structured machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Files Included
•	Google_Colab.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
•	Neural_Network_Report.md – A detailed report on the deep learning model's structure, training, and performance.
•	README.md – This file, providing an overview of the project and its structure.
Data Preprocessing
•	The dataset includes various categorical and numerical features related to funding applications.
•	Irrelevant columns, such as EIN and NAME, were removed.
•	The target variable is IS_SUCCESSFUL, indicating whether a funding application was approved.
Model Details
•	Architecture: A sequential neural network with two hidden layers.
•	Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers, Sigmoid for the output layer.
•	Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy.
•	Optimizer: Adam.
•	Epochs: 100.
Performance
•	The model was evaluated based on accuracy and loss.
•	Various optimizations, including hyperparameter tuning, were attempted to improve performance.
Alternative Approach
If further improvements are needed, alternative models like Random Forest or XGBoost could be explored, as they often perform well on structured datasets.
Instructions
1.	Clone the repository or download the necessary files.
2.	Open Google_Colab.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.
3.	Review the results and report in Neural_Network_Report.md.
Summary
The deep learning model successfully classified funding applications with a certain level of accuracy. However, further improvements may be necessary to achieve optimal performance. A potential alternative model for this classification problem could be a Random Forest classifier or XGBoost, as these models are robust with categorical and numerical data and often perform well on structured datasets. These methods could be explored to compare performance with the neural network approach.
